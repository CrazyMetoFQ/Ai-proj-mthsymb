**Math Wiz**
A project which provides aid to people who do not have full or have limited access to infornmation regarding maths and no ways to get help due to no access to wquality educastion. We intend to help them by providing a step by step explanation and solution for the given qeustion.
We will have different parts depending on the types of questions and users will have to upload their qeustion in the section which uses computer vision to analyze and provide the solution as given above. MathWiz will also use Data, NLP and CV which are all 3 domains of AI. 
Through this project, we will be able to solve the problem which we as students have experience ourselves.
Hope you enjoy it.
